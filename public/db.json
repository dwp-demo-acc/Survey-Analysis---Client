The average satisfaction scores for all questions were above 6.5 on a scale of 1 to 7, indicating a positive sentiment among respondents. The majority of respondents gave the highest possible satisfaction score for all questions, further emphasizing the high level of customer satisfaction.<br>\n\n<b>Anomalies and Findings:</b><br>\n\n1. <b>Project Type Satisfaction:</b> The 'Proposal/Bid' project type consistently received lower satisfaction scores compared to other project types. This suggests that there may be some issues with this project type that need to be addressed to improve customer satisfaction.<br>\n\n2. <b>Quality Inconsistency:</b> The 'Presentation' project type received the highest number of responses and had a wide range of satisfaction scores. This indicates that while many customers were highly satisfied with this project type, there were also some who were less satisfied. This suggests that there may be some inconsistency in the quality of service for this project type.<br>\n\n3. <b>Member Firm Satisfaction:</b> The data also revealed some variations in customer satisfaction across different member firms. For example, China had the highest mean satisfaction score, while NSE Switzerland had the lowest. This suggests that there may be differences in the level of service provided by different member firms.<br>\n\n<b>Customer Feedback:</b><br>\n\nCustomers frequently praised the speed, efficiency, quality of work, and professionalism of the team. However, there were also some suggestions for improvement, such as streamlining the submission process, improving consistency in quality, and enhancing communication.<br>\n\n<b>Conclusion:</b><br>\n\nWhile the overall level of customer satisfaction is high, there are some areas for improvement. Focusing on these areas could lead to an overall increase in customer satisfaction."
