On the other hand, the 'Consulting' function has the lowest mean satisfaction score of 6.479, suggesting a relatively lower level of satisfaction.\n\n<br>2. Response Distribution: The majority of responses across all functions are concentrated towards the higher end of the scale (6 and 7), indicating a generally high level of satisfaction. However, there are some variations. For instance, the 'Additional functions/business units' function has a relatively higher number of responses in the mid-range (3 to 5), suggesting a more mixed level of satisfaction.\n\n<br>3. Minimal Category: The minimal category shows the lowest score received in each function. Most functions have a minimum score of 0, except for 'Audit & Assurance', 'Consulting', and 'Risk Advisory' which have a minimum score of 4, 2, and 4 respectively. This indicates that these functions did not receive any extremely low scores.\n\n<br>4. Maximum Category: The maximum category shows the highest score received in each function. All functions have a maximum score of 7, indicating that each function received at least some highly positive feedback.\n\n<br>5. Outliers: There are no significant outliers in the data. The responses are generally consistent across all functions, with most responses falling in the high range of the scale.\n\n<br>In conclusion, while there is a generally high level of satisfaction across all functions, there are some variations. The 'Global Tax & Legal' function stands out with the highest mean satisfaction score, while the 'Consulting' function has the lowest.

This further supports the high average score for this firm.\n\n<br>5. The minimum category shows that NSE The segmentation Switzerland has the highest number of respondents (39) who gave the lowest score for project management. This aligns with the lower average score for this firm.\n\n<br>6. There is a significant variation in the distribution of scores across the firms. For example, in the United States, there is a relatively even distribution of scores from 1 to 10, whereas in China, the majority of scores are at the higher end of the scale.\n\n<br>7. An anomaly in the data is the score of 0 for Australia, Canada, and Deloitte Global. This could potentially be due to a lack of responses or a data entry error.\n\n<br>8. The data shows a clear trend of higher satisfaction scores for larger firms such as the United States and China.

For instance, the 'Basic formatting' category has a higher number of respondents who rated 7 (743) compared to the 'Complex design' (131) and 'Enhanced formatting/design' (720) categories. This could suggest that customers requiring basic formatting found the communication of expectations and challenges to be clearer.\n\n4. The 'Complex design' category has the least number of respondents across all rating levels, which could be due to a smaller sample size or lower response rate. This category also has the highest mean score (6.69), indicating that despite the complexity of the design, the communication of expectations and challenges was perceived positively.\n\n5. The 'Enhanced formatting/design' category shows a wider spread of scores, with a noticeable number of respondents rating 2 (20) and 5 (28). This could indicate some variability in the perception of communication clarity within this category.\n\n6. The minimal category data shows that the 'Enhanced formatting/design' category has the highest number of respondents who rated 1 (9), 2 (20), and 3 (11). This suggests that there may be some dissatisfaction or confusion among these customers regarding the communication of expectations and challenges.\n\n7. The maximum category data shows that no respondents in the 'Complex design' category rated 0 or 1, which is a positive sign. However, this category also has the lowest number of respondents who rated 7 (131), which could indicate room for improvement in communication clarity.\n\nIn conclusion, while the overall sentiment towards the communication of expectations and challenges is positive, there are some variations across the design categories.

Overall Satisfaction: The mean satisfaction scores across all project types are relatively high, ranging from 6.07 to 6.86 on a scale of 0 to 7. This indicates that, in general, customers are satisfied with how their instructions/changes are addressed across different project types.\n\n2. Highest Satisfaction: The project type with the highest mean satisfaction score is 'Advertisement/Twitter Card' at 6.86, followed closely by 'Flyer/Sales Sheet/Fact Sheet' at 6.84 and 'Video Editing' at 6.83. This suggests that these project types are particularly effective at addressing instructions/changes accurately.\n\n3.

These project types may require more attention to improve the accuracy of addressing instructions/changes.\n\n4. Variations: There are significant variations in the distribution of scores across different project types. For instance, 'Presentation' has a wide range of scores from 1 to 535, indicating a diverse range of customer experiences. On the other hand, 'Account Branding' and 'Animation/Motion Graphics' have a narrower range of scores, suggesting more consistent customer experiences.\n\n5.

For instance, the 'Basic formatting' category has a wider spread of responses, with scores ranging from 2 to 744. In contrast, the 'Complex design' category has a narrower spread, with scores ranging from 0 to 130. This could suggest that customers are more consistent in their satisfaction with complex designs.\n\nThe 'Enhanced formatting/design' category has a slightly higher frequency of lower scores (1 to 5) compared to the other categories. This could indicate some dissatisfaction among customers with how instructions or changes are addressed in enhanced formatting designs.\n\nIn terms of anomalies, the 'Complex design' category has no responses in the 3 category, which is unusual compared to the other categories. This could be due to a smaller sample size or it could indicate that customers are less likely to give a middling score for complex designs.\n\nIn conclusion, while overall satisfaction is high across all design categories, there are some variations and anomalies that could be explored further. For instance, why are customers more consistently satisfied with complex designs? And why is there a slightly higher frequency of lower scores in the 'Enhanced formatting/design' category?
